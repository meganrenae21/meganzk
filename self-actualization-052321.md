Maslow saw Self-actualization as a "growth" need, while the others were "deficiency" needs. In other words, the motivation of the other needs came from a lack of them, while we are naturally drawn to the process of self-actualization out of a desire to grow.

The idea behind this need is that even with all other needs fulfilled, true contentment can't be achieved unless we feel like we are doing what we are *meant* to be doing. Maslow put it this way:

>A musician must make music, an artist must paint, a poet must write, if he is to be ultimately happy. What a man can be, he must be.

*from [A theory of human motivation, Maslow, 1943](maslow-1943)*
