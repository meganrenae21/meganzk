## Things I'm wondering about

- The connection between laziness (or what is perceived as laziness) and mental health
- The intersections between external and internal motivations with regard to character development in storytelling
- The Capulets and Montagues - and how violence begets violence, on any scale, from the personal to the geopolitical
- Wondering how to get better at taking a break from the projects I'm absorbed in, and tending to my needs
- Why do the jokes that take me a few moments to understand end up being the ones that make me laugh the most?
