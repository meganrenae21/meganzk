1. **Reject the diet mentality.** 
   - Health and weight loss are not synonymous. Diets lead to weight cycling, decreased metabolism, and are not making us healthier, despite what diet culture would have us believe. Diets fail; people do not.
2. **Honor your hunger.** 
   - Keep your body adequately fed. Do not allow yourself to enter into excessive hunger by restrictive practices. Listen to your body's signals.
3. **Make peace with food.** 
   - Give yourself unconditional permission to eat. Don't feel guilt over what you eat.
4. **Challenge the food police**
   - Don't get into the habit of calling certain foods "good" or "bad" or having some intrinsic moral value.
5. **Discover the satisfaction factor**
   - Understand how to take pleasure and meaning from the eating experience itself. Savor.
6. **Feel your fullness**
   - Listen for your body signals, which will tell you when you are full, what your current hunger level is. Learn your body's satiety signals.
7. **Cope with your emotions with kindness**
   - Offer yourself self-love and compassion. Food won't fix your feelings, but offers comfort in the short term.
8. **Respect your body**
   - Don't try to contort yourself into an image you are not genetically made for. Your body was made for you and it deserves dignity.
9. **Movement -- Feel the difference**
    - Focus on how it feels just to move your body just for movement's sake, rather than the calorie-burning effect on exercise. Focus on how working out makes you feel, rather than the weight loss desire.
10. **Honor your health with gentle nutrition**
    - Make food choices that taste good and make you feel good. You don't have to eat perfectly to be healthy. Progress, not perfection.
