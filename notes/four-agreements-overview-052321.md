## Be impeccable with your word

- What you say matters. This includes how you talk to others and yourself
- Words come back to you. What you put out is often what we get back.
- *impeccable*: from Latin word "peccatus" meaning "sin" and "im" meaning "without"
- *sin*: to go against yourself
- in other words, **don't go against yourself**

## Don't take anything personally

- Don't rely on the opinions of others for your self-worth
- What others think of you is about them, not you.

## Don't make assumptions

- When someone says no, that means no - don't invent anything further inside of your head (such as 'They must hate me')
- Filling in the gaps can cause us to create a false reality, leading to conflict and hurt feelings that are not necessary.
- Clear communication is essential. Don't pretend to know.

## Always do your best

- If you do the best you can, you have no reason to be ashamed of yourself or feel bad or guilty.
- Your "best" will vary from day to day. Some days will be easier than others.
- Doing your best doesn't mean overstretching yourself. It doesn't mean doing as well as others. It simply means doing the best you can at any given moment.
