## Q1. What is the difference between megan zk and your blog, [Meg in Progress](https://meganrenae21.github.io/Meg-in-Progress)â†—?

*megan-zk* is a thinking space, while Meg in Progress is a writing space. Not good enough? Fine.

This is a space for me to process whatever is on my mind at the moment, without the need to perfect or polish right away. This space builds upon previous notes to expand my repertoire of knowledge. It allows me to make connections between different thoughts, and process them organically. There's no "final draft" but everything is constantly in revision mode.

Meg in Progress, on the other hand, is where everything is a final draft. The writings there are planned, outlined, polished, and presented carefully. It's like the speech you prepare for and give at a high-class event, while mzk is just a low-key informal conversation among friends about whatever comes to mind.
