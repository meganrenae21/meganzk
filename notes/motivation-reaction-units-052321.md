The small-scale structure of a scene involves a sequence of "Motivation-Reaction Units" or MRUs.

- **Motivation**: something happens that the POV character can see or hear or taste or smell or feel. External. Objective.
- **Reaction**: how the POV character responds to the Motivation. Internal and subjective.
