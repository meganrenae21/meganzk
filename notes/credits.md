[hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/)↗ - hypothes.is is a browser extension for annotating any website. With it, you can highlight and make notes on anything you find online. I use this to mark up the sources I find (see my [references](categories/reference) on the internet, and the annotations I make are adapted to notes here.
