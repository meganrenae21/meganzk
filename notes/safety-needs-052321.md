A step up from Physiological Needs, *Safety Needs* are more about *stability* and *security*. One way to look at it is this: physiological needs are recurring *episodic* needs that arise in moments of desperation or imminent threat. This is why they may override other needs. *Safety* needs, on the other hand, are *chronic* in nature, not only arising when the danger is imminent. If the threat of starvation if you don't find something to eat soon is a physiological motivation, a *safety* motivation would be if you have something to eat now, but are unsure if you have enough to make it through tomorrow.

With this in mind, we can see how a family living paycheck to paycheck would have motivations driven largely by safety needs.
