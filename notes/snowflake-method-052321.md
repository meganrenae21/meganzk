## The Eight Steps

### Step 1: Write a one-sentence summary of your novel

**Time:** 1 hour

Example: "A rogue physicist travels back in time to kill the apostle Paul"

Guidelines:

- Try to make it 15 words or less
- Don't use names, just character descriptions 
- Combine the big picture stake with the personal stake
  
*Note: try to include at least 3 of the 5 elements of the [5W Story Planning Method](5W-story-planning-method-052321)*

### Step 2: Expand the one-sentence summary into a paragraph

**Time:** 1 hour

The paragraph should include

- Story set up (inciting incident)
- Major disasters
- Ending

Tips:

- Can use the "3 disasters plus an ending" formula
  >A character goes on a mission. Something goes wrong, so the mission takes a turn. Something else goes wrong, and the mission takes another turn. The another thing goes wrong, and the mission is threatened. Then the resolution happens.
  >
- Sentence 1: story backdrop and set up
- Sentence 2-4: Each disaster
- Sentence 5: Ending

*Note: The paragraph should include all five elements of the [5W Story Planning Mehtod](5W-story-planning-method-052321)*

### Step 3: For each character, write a one-page summary describing major details about the character

**Time:** 1 hour for each character

Details of the character summary:

- Character name
- One-sentence summary of the character's storyline
- Character's abstract motivation
- Character's concrete goal
- Character conflict (what obstacle keeps them from reaching the goal)
- Character's epiphany (what the character learns, how they change)
- One-paragraph summary of the character's storyline

*Note: You may need to go back to revise your summary from step 3 after completing this step*

### Step 4: Expand each sentence in the summary paragraph from step 2 into a paragraph of its own, creating a 5-paragraph summary

**Time:** Several hours

All but the last paragraph should end in a disaster. The last paragraph tells how the story ends.

### Step 5: Write up one-page summaries (synopses) for each main character describing the events of the story in their own POV, and half-page synopses for each minor character

**Time:** 1-2 days

### Step 6: Expand the five-paragraph/one-page plot synopsis into a four-page synopsis

**Time:** 1 week

Again, expand each paragraph from Step 4 into a full page. Or expand each sentence into a full paragraph. Add more detail, smaller plot points, fine-tune how you get from one point to another.

### Step 7: Create full-fledged character charts detailing everything you know about each character

**Time:** 1 week

- This is an expansion of your work in step 3
- Things like personality, goal
- Also dynamic information - how the character changes throughout the novel

### Step 8: Make a spreadsheet of all the scenes in the novel

**Time:** Unknown
