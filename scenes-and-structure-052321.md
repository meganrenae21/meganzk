## Scene: The POV character has a goal and starts out *proactive*

Structure:

1. **Goal** - the POV character has an objective
2. **Conflict** - there are obstacles on the way for the POV character to achieve the objective
3. **Disaster** - the POV character fails to reach their objective

## Sequel: Takes place after a *Scene*, in which the POV character *reacts* to the disaster

Structure:

1. **Reaction** - the POV character has a reaction to the disaster of the previous scene.
2. **Dilemma** - the POV character has options, but none of them good, and has to figure out the least-bad option.
3. **Decision** - the option the character picks.
